Static keyword-

static keyword can be applied to variables and methods.

1) Static methods can access static stuff directly without creating object.
2) Static methods can access non-static stuff through object.
3) Non-static methods can access everything directly.


Exercise:

Q. How  we can access a variable outside of the class?
   e.g.  How we can access String variable outside of class 
         and how we can find length of variable outside of the class?
   
   public class Test {
      
      Static String s = "welcome";
   }
   
 Answer: Test.s.length();
 
 Q. What is System.out.println(), how it is derived?
 Answer:
 
   public class System {
      
      static PrintStream out; 
   }
   
   -------------
   System - PreDefined class
   PrintStream - class
   out - variable
   println() is a method of PrintStream class
   
   So, outside of the System class we can access the out variable.
   
   System.out.println();
