Type Casting:-

It is conversion of one data type into another data type.

Types:
1) Up Casting / Widening : Converting the value from smaller --> larger
   - UpCasting is automatic process. Means, we can directly store int value in long
     and float value into double.
  
   e.g.
         int --> long
         float --> double

2) Down Casting / Narrowing : Converting the value from larger --> smaller
   - It is manual process. We have to do this explicitly
  e.g.
         long --> int
         double --> float


# Both are applicable for primitive data types as well as for objects also.
