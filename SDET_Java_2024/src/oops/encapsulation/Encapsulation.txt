// Session 12

Encapsulation:-

Wrapping of data and methods into a single unit(class).

Rules: 
1) All the variables in the class should be private.
2) For every variable there should be 2methods (get and set)
3) Variables can be operated only through methods. 
   We cannot access those variable in another class directly using object of a class. 
   We've to use getters and setters methods to access those private variables.
