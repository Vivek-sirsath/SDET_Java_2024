Constructor: 

# It is used to assign the values to the variables.
# No operation should be performed in a constructor.

-- Overloading can be done by changing the order of the parameters.
-- Overloading can be done by changing the number of parameters.
-- Overloading can be done by having the same number of parameters but with different data types.

# [We cannot overload constructors by changing the return type as constructors do not have a return type]
