Polymorphism: 

# One thing can have many forms

# Shape - Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle are forms of shape.
# Water - Vapor, IceBerg are forms of water.

# We can achieve polymorphism using overloading.

void m1()
void m1()
void m1()

Same methods with same name will give error

Types: Method Overloading , Constructor Overloading 

[NOTE: We will not consider the return type of method.
       We only consider the following rules]

Four Rules of method overloading:-
1) Method names should be same.
2) Number of parameters should be different.
3) Data type of parameters should be different.
4) Order of parameters should be different.
